<h1>NodeJS Tutorial</h1>

NodeJS is a JS runtime.  Allows running Javascript outside the browser. NodeJS uses V8. It also adds
additional features. One of these features is access to the file system API.

You can enter a Node REPL environment by writing `node` into the command line.

Can run your own files with `node <file-name>`.

The main file is often named `app.js` or `server.js`.
